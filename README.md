# Forking this repo (please read)

I value the fact that my website (portfolio) is open source, but as we all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disappointing to discover that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. 
I put in a lot of time and effort to build and design this version of my website, and I'm proud of it! 

All I ask is PLEASE ðŸ¥º, give me some credit.
